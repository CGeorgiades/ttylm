# TTYLM
## Teletype Login Manager

Simple terminal-based login manager for Linux-based systems
Meant for use as a replacement for resource-heavy login managers like sddm, gdm, or other graphical login managers.
Also meant to provide slightly more functionality than a simple *login(1)* prompt at startup
Allows running of a terminal, a graphical system (by running startx), rebooting, and shutting down the system.
